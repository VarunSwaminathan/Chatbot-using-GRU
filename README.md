# Chatbot using GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)
This repository contains an implementation of a chatbot using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a type of recurrent neural network designed for handling sequential data efficiently. The GRU-based chatbot is trained on conversational datasets to provide context-aware and meaningful responses.

### Overview
The GRU model is known for its ability to handle long-term dependencies in sequences, making it an excellent choice for tasks involving natural language processing (NLP). In this project, GRU is employed to power the chatbot, which can engage in conversational dialogues by learning from historical chat data.

### Features
GRU-Based Architecture: Utilizes GRU for sequence learning and context retention.
Conversational Bot: Trained to engage in human-like conversations with context-aware responses.
Customizable Dataset: Can be trained on various conversational datasets.
Pretrained Embeddings: Supports pretrained embeddings like GloVe or Word2Vec for improved semantic understanding.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
TensorFlow or PyTorch
NLTK
NumPy
Scikit-learn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/VarunSwaminathan/Chatbot-using-GRU.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```
   cd Chatbot-using-GRU

### Results
The GRU-based chatbot is designed to maintain conversational flow by understanding context and providing relevant responses. This implementation demonstrates how GRUs can be effectively used for conversational AI tasks.
